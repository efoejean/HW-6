<!-- TODO: Describe how the data was generated.
  Reference 'faker' on npmjs.com
  Reference Array.from on MDN.
  Reference `fs` for NodeJS. ⬅️ Don't worry too much about this one. It's a bit tough for now.
  Whatever else you want.
  Write it up (MarkDown) or do a walkthrough video.

  Remove 🔥 this TODO when completed. Replace this with what you come up with.

<!-- TODO: Once you have data in `app.data.js`, import it in and delete out the contents of `index.js`.
In `index.js`, write the code to log the following info:
  1. Which vehicle has the highest mileage? Research Array.sort on MDN for this.
  2. What is the total mileage of every single vehicle added together in the entire database (use `reduce`)?
  3. Filter 'yahoo.com' emails.
  4. Filter vehicles with more than 36K miles. I am only interested in the vehicle information, so you will need to chain a map to this and return objects that just have that information (none of the personal info).
  5. Filter out all IL (or any other state) vehicles. Sum up the total mileage for just these. Use a chain: filter ➡️ reduce.
